# E-Shop Back-End 

## Description 

The back-end of an online storefront's website powered by node and MySQL! This was built as a way to understand ORMs and interacting with databases in the context of server operations. I furthered my knowledge of Sequelize and rrouting as well!<br>

## Installation

Download the relevant files onto your computer. Using node, install all dependencies with the command "node install". You will need to create a database with the queries found in "schema.sql" before use. <br>

## Usage

[Here is a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rdqYvkqoyEdw4OREMky-UUSGAEEyufZG/view) showcasing this program's functionality. <br>
Once all files and dependencies have been downloaded, run the commend "npm start" to start the server! GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests can be made using an API platform of your choice. The walkthrough video linked above demonstrates the possible requests that can be made and is using Postman. <br>
